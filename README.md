# NLP-with-Deep-Learning
In this repository, i will be making some cool projects in NLP from basic to intermediate level.

1) In the first folder, i created a basic RNN architecture to help understand the basics and how to use an rnn for
   sequential time-series data.
2) Second consist of a basic SPAM CLASSIFIER which classifies an email spam or ham. It gives a basic ituition on
   how to use NLTK library for preprocessing texts and a basic RNN model to train.
3) In youtube classifer, the idea is to provide a youtube channel name and predict its category using that particular 
   channel's video title and description.
